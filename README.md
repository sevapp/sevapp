My name is Vsevolod) I have been successfully working as a programmer for more than four years, and I have been studying programming for even longer. I have extensive experience in organization and optimization workflows, in developing projects from scratch: from SPA applications to embedded systems. I have a fairly broad outlook in the world of technology, I know how to select technical solutions and design. A special place in my life is occupied by the process of reserch, learning new languages, practices, technologies, and so on.
